ODL Project Update – July 20th 

My final project deliverable will be an Open Data Alliance Guidebook that will include these documents:
-	Open Data Alliance Principles 
o	A one-sheet set of guiding Open Data principles for ODA members. Including the ODA mission statement. 
-	Interview Consolidation – A Thematic Distillation 
o	A document that will be in our appendices that identifies the themes we found from our interviews concerning open data and the ODA. Each theme will include an explanation and an addressing of the issues in the theme. At this point, all themes have a component of concerns and these concerns will be addressed. 
-	How to Identify Valuable Datasets
o	A one-sheet that contains recommendations for identifying valuable datasets. It will include categories of recommended datasets provided by the WA OCIO, a study done by the Sunlight Foundation, and by our analysis of three public records request logs. It will also include recommendations for what is needed to identify valuable datasets in the future.   
-	Outreach & Growth 
o	Located in the appendices, this document will include several open data resources for ease of access, suggestions for technical resources such as workshops to gain technical skills, suggestions for community engagement that identify organizations for possible future interaction, and suggestions for membership lead skill-sharing activities. 
-	Open Data Alliance Agendas 
o	The creation of a solid first meeting agenda including the introduction to our project, the show and tell activity session, exploration of new repository for communal datasets and documents, and a rotating schedule for future hosting sites. There will also be three other agendas outlined for future meetings and a selection of topics for those meetings, chosen through the format of an unconference at the first meeting.

Most of the items listed still require finalization and so I will list off each project with what still needs to be completed and the assigned due dates.
